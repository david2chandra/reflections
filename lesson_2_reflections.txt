What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It will start to monitor the folder. Init is needed in order to prepare all of the necessary files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
We can selectively choose file(s) to be monitor by git.
